# RFSAR
This a proof of concept for a GUI Tool for Floodmapping using Random Forests Machine Learning and Synthetic Aperture Radar.
This Tool was developed in Java for the GEE Code Editor API. 
# Methodology 
This section details the algorithm, as illustrated in Figure 3, which is applied for SAR-based flood mapping using the RF classifier in the case study. The process encompasses compiling input features, sample design, implementing the Random Forest classifier, followed by post-processing, and concluding with performance assessment.
